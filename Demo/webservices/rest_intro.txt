REST APIs

REpresentational State Transfer

In terms of creating a CRUD interface, you already know how to do this:

create.php
read.php
update.php
delete.php

When creating a REST interface (Web Service), instead of using multiple
URLs, you will be accessing your interface using a single URL

In the interface we will create over the next few weeks,
this REST service will provide for:

Creating, reading, updating, deleting records.

When using a REST interface (or Web Service API), you use different HTTP
verbs to specify what you want TO DO with the resource.

The resource is spcified by the URL.
the action is specified by the HTTP VERB.

So, for our CRUD application, we will use the following VERBs with the
following actions:

POST    -> for creating records
GET     -> for reading records
PUT     -> for updating records
DELETE  -> for deleting records
